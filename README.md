This is the home page / landing page where randomly loaded motivational quotes are displayed and scraped with BeautifulSoup.<br>
Explore page = posts from all Gymstagram users are displayed ordered by latest time stamp. <br>
Followers page = posts from those you follow are visible and displayed by latest time stamp.<br>
As a logged in user, you're able to observe the posted user's image, caption, and exercises. You're also able to interact with the posted user by liking or commenting on the post.

## Mock-up 

There are a few tools for mock-ups. Paper prototypes (low-tech, but effective and cheap), Digital picture edition software (gimp / photoshop / etc.), or dedicated tools like moqups.com (I'm calling out moqups here in particular since it seems to strike the best balance between "easy-to-use" and "wants your money" -- the free teir isn't perfect, but it should be sufficient for our needs with a little "creative layout" to get around the page-limit)

In this space please either provide images (around 4) showing your prototypes, OR, a link to an online hosted mock-up tool like moqups.com

**[Add images/photos that show your paper prototype (around 4)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) along with a very brief caption:**
